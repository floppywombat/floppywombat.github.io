This GitHub account was created a while back while I was learning to code things in my personal time.  It has two repositories, currently.

The floppywombat.github.io repository was created as a part of my week CTI-110 week 6 lab.  For now, it contains only this README file, which is being edited on the Test branch.

Cloning this repository onto my local harddrive was simple.  When using the desktop application, it can be done in basically three steps:
    1. Select the repository you wish to clone
    2. Select the destination folder you wish to clone the repository to
    3. Click "Clone Repository"

From there, you can navigate to the location on your harddrive and find the files from your repository.
